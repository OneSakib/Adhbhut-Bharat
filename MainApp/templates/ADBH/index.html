    <!-- Summary indian history !-->
    <div class="container-lg mt-3">
        <h5>What is the brief history of India?</h5>
        <p>The history of India starts with the existence of India itself as It located in the continent of Asia, India
            covers 2,973,193 square kilometers of land and 314,070 square kilometers of water. </p>
        <p>Making it the 7th largest nation in the world with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometers. Surrounded by
            Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to the North East, China to the North, Pakistan to the North West, and Sri
            Lanka on the South East coast. </p>
        <p>India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic, and cultural configurations are the
            products of a long process of regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus Valley
            Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic
            age. Hinduism arose in the Vedic period.</p>
        <p>The fifth-century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in his
            reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to India for the first
            time and by the eleventh century had firmly established itself in India as a political force. It resulted in
            the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire, under which India
            once again achieved a large measure of political unity.</p>
        <p>It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration of the
            Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English emerged
            'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed; and with the
            subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation of India into the empire was
            complete. It was followed by India's struggle for independence, which we got in the year 1947. Here is a
            brief timeline about the history of India:</p>
        <h5>Ancient India History</h5>
        <p>The History of India begins with the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases
            are generally described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic periods. The earliest literary source that sheds light on
            India's past is the Rig Veda. It is difficult to date this work with any accuracy on the basis of tradition
            and ambiguous astronomical information contained in the hymns. Indus valley civilization, which flourished
            between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, had an advanced and flourishing economic system. The Indus valley people
            practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, made tools and weapons from copper, bronze, and tin and even
            traded with some Middle East countries.</p>
        <h5>The Indus Valley Civilization</h5>
        <p>
            A long time ago, in the eastern world, there rose a few civilizations. The main reasons for the rise of
            these urban civilizations were access to rivers, which served various functions of human beings. Along with
            the Mesopotamian civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the Indus Valley civilization spanning
            Northwest India and modern-day Pakistan. The largest amongst the three civilizations, the Indus Valley
            civilization flourished around 2600 BC, at which time agriculture in India started flourishing. The fertile
            Indus valley made it possible for agriculture to be carried out on a large scale. The most well-known towns
            of the Indus Valley in today’s date are Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. Unearthing these two towns showed
            excavators glimpses into the richness of the Indus Valley civilization, evidenced in ruins and things like
            household articles, war weapons, gold and silver ornament - and so on. The people of the Indus Valley
            civilization lived in well-planned towns and well-designed houses made of baked bricks. In an era of
            developments and prosperity, civilization, unfortunately, came to an end by around 1300 BC, mainly due to
            natural calamities. </p>
        <h5>Vedic Civilization</h5>
        <p>The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization, flourishing along the river Saraswati, named
            after the Vedas, which depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest epics of this period were
            the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great reverence by the followers of Hinduism</p>
        <h5>Buddhist Era</h5>
        <p>Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which were the sixteen great powers, during
            the 7th and the 6th centuries BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and the
            Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha Gautam, was born in Lumbini near
            Kapilavastu and was the founder of Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died at the age of 80 in
            480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern Asia and are followed across the world
            today. </p>
        <h5>The Invasion of Alexander</h5>
        <p>When Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, he crossed the Indus river and defeated the Indian rulers in battle.
            Noteworthy of the Indians’ attempts at war, was the use of elephants, something that the Macedonians had
            never seen before. Alexander then took over the lands of the defeated kings.</p>
        <h5>The Gupta Dynasty</h5>
        <p>The Gupta period has been referred to as the Golden Age of Indian history. When Chandragupt I received the
            gift of Pataliputra in dowry when he married the daughter of the chief of the ‘Licchavis’, he started to lay
            down the foundation of his empire, which extended from the river Ganges or the Ganga to the city of
            Allahabad. He ruled for 15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king of kings’ for his strategic conquests
            and the flourishing state of India. </p>
        <h5>Harshavardhana</h5>
        <p>The last of the ancient kingdoms in India was by the king Harshavardhana, who ascended the throne at
            Thanneshwar and Kannauj after his brother died. While successful in a few of his conquests, he eventually
            got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India. Harshavardhana was well-known for establishing
            relations with the Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong administrative
            capabilities. </p>
        <h5>Medieval Indian History</h5>
        <p>The medieval history of India is renowned for deriving a lot of its character from Islamic kingdoms.
            Extending across almost three generations, medieval India included a number of kingdoms and dynasties:
            - The Chalukyas
            - The Pallavas
            - The Pandyas
            - The Rashtrakutas
            - The Cholas</p>
        <p>The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th Century AD. Their kingdom covered a large
            part of South India, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely and carried out
            the annexation of multiple territories in India, the empire came to an end in the 14th Century AD with an
            invasion by a man named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still intact and are known for
            their rustic charm. </p>
        <p>The next major empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in Islamic rulers. The invasion of Timur
            was a significant point in Indian history before a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti movement, came
            to be. Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire started to rise. One of the greatest empires of
            India, the Mughal empire was a rich and glorious one, with the whole of India united and ruled by one
            monarch. The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah Suri (not a Mughal king), Akbar, Jehangir, Shah
            Jahan, and Aurangzeb. They were responsible for setting up efficient public administration, laying out
            infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of monuments in India today exist from the Mughal
            period. The death of the last Mughal King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of disintegration within India.
            Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal kings are still looked back in awe. </p>
        <h5>Akbar</h5>
        <p>Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, was the third emperor of the
            Mughal Empire, after Babur and Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and succeeded him as the
            emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13 years old.</p>
        <h5>Shah Jahan</h5>
        <p>Shah Jahan, also known as Shahbuddin Mohammed Shah Jahan, was a Mughal Emperor who ruled in the Indian
            Subcontinent from 1628 to 1658. He was the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Jahangir.
            Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting against his father, Jahangir.</p>
        <h5>Chhatrapati Shivaji</h5>
        <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one
            of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the
            folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to capture a part of, the then, dominant Mughal
            empire.</p>
        <h5>Modern Indian History</h5>
        <p>During the late 16th and the 17th Centuries, the European trading companies in India competed with each other
            ferociously. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and established
            themselves as the dominant power in India. The British administered India for a period of about two
            centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the social, political and economic life of the country.
        </p>
        <p>However, the zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British arrived in the early 1600s as traders.
            Capitalizing on the disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the British actively used
            the strategy of ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over India for over 2 centuries. While the British had come in
            earlier, they only achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of Plassey. </p>
        <p>They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered and have been looked back at as
            plunderers of India’s wealth of resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst numerous
            other resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the
            Indians steam engines, it is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was divisive
            and pit Indians against one another, on the basis of religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians
            were essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any returns on their work. This,
            naturally, led to multiple mutinies; and prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different
            ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of gaining freedom; however, they all had one
            common goal - freedom. </p>
        <p>The British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help India progress - however, multiple
            problems arose without the consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was when in the
            First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on behalf of India, even though India did not wish
            for that to happen; and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British Indian Army during
            both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian resistance. Over a million Indian soldiers were killed in
            both the World Wars.</p>
